# Charts & Graphs of Matplotlib

### About 
A refrence guide when working with Matplotlib

### Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Matplotlib

### What I learned:
In this project I wanted to create a refrence for some of the graphs and charts I use within Matplotlib. These are very common in most projects so I wanted to have a refrence, but also practice while doing so. I am truly learning the ropes of Matplotlib.pyplot and enjoy the plotting experience.
